## üìñ About This Project

ScanSavvy AI is a complete modernization of the legacy open-source application "OpenNoteScanner". This project showcases a ground-up refactoring using a 100% Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and modern MVVM architecture. The complex OpenCV pipeline was replaced with Google's on-device **ML Kit** for a smarter and more reliable scanning experience.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Effortless Scanning:** Uses Google's ML Kit for a polished UI with auto-crop and enhancement.
*   **On-Device OCR:** Extracts text from documents to make them searchable.
*   **Smart Titling:** Automatically names new scans based on their content.
*   **Full-Text Search:** Instantly find documents by searching for words inside them.
*   **Secure & Private:** 100% offline with optional biometric app lock.
*   **PDF Export:** Share documents as searchable, multi-page PDFs.
*   **Modern UI:** Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, including Dark Mode and Material You theming.
